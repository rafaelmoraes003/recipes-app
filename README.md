###

<p align="left">The project's goal was to create an application capable of communicating with two APIs, one for data about food and another for drinks. It should also be possible to search by ingredient, name or the first letter of a recipe (in addition to being able to filter them by category).<br><br>When clicking on a recipe, the user goes to the recipes page, where he can see details about ingredients and preparation, in addition to being able to copy the recipe link, bookmark or start its preparation, which can only be completed if all ingredients are marked with a check.<br><br>In addition, it was possible to enter the explore screen, where options by ingredient, nationality or a surprise recipe appeared.<br><br>Finally, it was possible to see which recipes the user had completed and favorited (both are saved in the local storage), being able to filter them by food and/or drink.</p>
